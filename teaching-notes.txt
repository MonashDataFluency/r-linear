Skipped limma section. Rushed in teeth section. Skipped multiple testing. Pace was otherwise good.

Formulas were a significant source of confusion:
- dropping the intercept and the factor getting an extra column was very confusing
- ~0 and ~1 models in slideshow were a bit confusing.

Move some discussion of formula syntax earlier.

Maybe go up to four hours to allow time for limma. Still had energy at the end of the workshop.

Here are some introductory talking points:

    View this workshop as "vocational training".
    Theory and practice will re-enforce each other.

    Exploration remains important, but not covered in detail today.

    Trying to provide a "complete" toolbox, up to a certain point.
    Trying to provide generic rather than specialized methods, skipping useful shortcuts.
    Statistics and R have a lot of history.
    I'm skipping over a lot -- people view the same underlying mathematics in different ways.
    Particularly ANOVA is a separate but often equivalent line of development.

    Presentation is generic, but somewhat shaded by needs in bioinformatics.

    Not covering GLMs or mixed models, however you will have a good foundation to learn about them.
    Many of the same functions apply.

    Now introduce yourself to your neighbours and introduce yourself on the etherpad.
